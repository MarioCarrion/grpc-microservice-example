# Tools as Dependencies

This follows the pattern described in [<img src="https://github.com/MarioCarrion/MarioCarrion/blob/main/youtube.svg" width="20" height="20" alt="YouTube video">](https://youtu.be/g_5n0W27XcY).

Although not required I encourage you to install [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to keep your tools _"sandboxed"_, that way in case your use case requires it, you can install different versions of the same tool on different projects.

For installing tools I use the [_Tools as Dependencies_](https://mariocarrion.com/2021/10/15/learning-golang-versioning-tools-as-dependencies.html) paradigm using Go modules, if you installed both `direnv` and `make` you can execute [`make tools`](../../Makefile#L1) directly to download and install the required packages.

The makefile installs the following Go binaries:

* **required** `buf` CLI for linting and compiling
* **required** Protocol Buffer Plugin for Go
* **required** gRPC Plugin for Go:
* **recommended** gRPC Health Check tester using `grpc-health-probe`
