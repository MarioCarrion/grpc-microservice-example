# "User Management" gRPC Microservice Example

## Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is an educational repository that includes a small microservice written in Go using gRPC, this is equivalent to the [REST Example](https://github.com/MarioCarrion/todo-api-microservice-example), however this project is the principal example of my video series: [System Design using gRPC with Go](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7yAAGMOat_EX1nv8fgltlm0CnJTH8Nwg).
